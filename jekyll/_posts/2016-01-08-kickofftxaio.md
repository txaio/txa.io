### The Why & What
After a couple of beers to figure out we wanted to have a technical blog. We enjoyed some more in order to boost up creativity to find a great idea for a domain name. He it is [txa.io](https://txa.io) ! It stands for Techkies (X)across the Alps. Since the scope of this blog will highly technical (Code, Tip-Tricks, Hacking, Web stuff security) if would be directed but not limited to the techkies living around the Alps.

### Modus operandi
One of our wish is also to make this project collaborative ! So if you have a good idea for a post which meets our scope (so basically everything technical ðŸ˜€), feel free to pull request the project and propose your changes. That's why everything is hosted on Github.
