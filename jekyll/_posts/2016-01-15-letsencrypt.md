 About a couple of weeks ago [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) went on the public beta phase. Letâ€™s Encrypt is a new zero-cost X.509 Certificate Authority that supports the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol.

This theme supports **link posts**, made famous by John Gruber. To use, just add `link: http://url-you-want-linked` to the post's YAML front matter and you're done.
